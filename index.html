  Welcome to the Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab in <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu">The Robotics Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>!

<p>
  Over 5 million people in the United States are living with paralysis; a sixth of the population is over the age of 65; and in 2014 more than a quarter of the population had a disability. 
  There is a growing need for care.

<p>
  Assistive robots can help empower people to live more independently and reduce the physical burden placed on our nurses and human caregivers. 
  Our group is keenly interested in the development of physically assistive robots that can help people who have loss of motor function due to neurodegenerative disease, stroke, or spinal cord injury. 
  We bring together researchers that explore the intersection of physically assistive robotics, machine learning, multimodal perception, mobile manipulation, physics simulation, and human-robot interaction.  
  We develop wearable interfaces and robot autonomy that enable individuals with loss of hand function to control assistive robots and perform physical activities of daily living again. 
  We further develop wearable devices for capturing physiological signals to inform and improve healthcare outcomes for a number of diseases.

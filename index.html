  Welcome to the Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab in <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu">The Robotics Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>!
  Our research aims at enabling intelligent physical human-robot interaction.
  We develop new computational, control, and sensing methods for robots to physically interact with and assist people.
  We bring together researchers that explore the intersection of physically assistive robotics, machine learning, physics simulation, perception, and human-robot interaction.
  Our research often has applications in healthcare robotics, including the advancement of robotic caregivers -- robots that assist older adults and people with disabilities to perform activities of daily living and live more independently.

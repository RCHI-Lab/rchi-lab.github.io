  abstract: "While robots present an opportunity to provide physical assistance to older adults and people with mobility impairments in bed, people frequently rest in bed with blankets that cover the majority of their body. To provide assistance for many daily self-care tasks, such as bathing, dressing, or ambulating, a caregiver must first uncover blankets from part of a person's body. In this work, we introduce a formulation for robotic bedding manipulation around people in which a robot uncovers a blanket from a target body part while ensuring the rest of the human body remains covered. We compare two approaches for optimizing policies which provide a robot with grasp and release points that uncover a target part of the body: 1) reinforcement learning and 2) self-supervised learning with optimization to generate training data. We trained and conducted evaluations of these policies in physics simulation environments that consist of a deformable cloth mesh covering a simulated human lying supine on a bed. In addition, we transfer simulation-trained policies to a real mobile manipulator and demonstrate that it can uncover a blanket from target body parts of a manikin lying in bed. Source code is available online."

#   abstract: "Towards the goal of robots performing robust and intelligent physical interactions with people, it is crucial that robots are able to accurately sense the human body, follow trajectories around the body, and track human motion. This study introduces a capacitive servoing control scheme that allows a robot to sense and navigate around human limbs during close physical interactions. Capacitive servoing leverages temporal measurements from a multi-electrode capacitive sensor array mounted on a robot's end effector to estimate the relative position and orientation (pose) of a nearby human limb. Capacitive servoing then uses these human pose estimates from a data-driven pose estimator within a feedback control loop in order to maneuver the robot's end effector around the surface of a human limb. We provide a design overview of capacitive sensors for human-robot interaction and then investigate the performance and generalization of capacitive servoing through an experiment with 12 human participants. The results indicate that multidimensional capacitive servoing enables a robot's end effector to move proximally or distally along human limbs while adapting to human pose. Using a cross-validation experiment, results further show that capacitive servoing generalizes well across people with different body size."

#   abstract: "Autonomous robots have the potential to serve as versatile caregivers that improve quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Yet, conducting research in this area presents numerous challenges, including the risks of physical interaction between people and robots. Physics simulations have been used to optimize and train robots for physical assistance, but have typically focused on a single task. In this paper, we present Assistive Gym, an open source physics simulation framework for assistive robots that models multiple tasks. It includes six simulated environments in which a robotic manipulator can attempt to assist a person with activities of daily living (ADLs): itch scratching, drinking, feeding, body manipulation, dressing, and bathing. Assistive Gym models a person's physical capabilities and preferences for assistance, which are used to provide a reward function. We present baseline policies trained using reinforcement learning for four different commercial robots in the six environments. We demonstrate that modeling human motion results in better assistance and we compare the performance of different robots. Overall, we show that Assistive Gym is a promising tool for assistive robotics research."
